Title:
Measurement and simulations of SOA in a chamber

Introduction:
We investigate formation of SOA from apinene in a laboratory.
Some work has already been done on this (Capes et al 2016).

Methodology:
We used some instruments to measure things (Allen et al 2004).
Here is some data that we are going to use (except not really).
